# EOCLU

EOCLU is a command line utility for [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) by
[CCP Games](https://www.ccpgames.com/).

## About

EOCLU seeks to offer a convenient command line interface for interacting with
the Tranquility server cluster. This utility is designed to be approachable by
users who are curious and may be new to this kind of thing, but also offer more
advanced features for users who want to use it to compose a larger script or
other program.

## Getting Started

EOCLU is distributed as a single binary compiled for Linux, macOS, or Windows.

1. Select the release package that is appropriate for your operating system and
   processor architecture.
2. Extract the `.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows) archive.
3. Place `eoclu` (`eoclu.exe` on Windows) in a location of your choice. You may
   want to ensure that the location is in
   [`PATH`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>) for your system if
   you would like to be able to access the utility globally.
4. Run `eoclu --help` from your terminal to see available commands and options.
